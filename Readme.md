# Bank tech test

Makers week 10 practice tech test. This is a mock "Take Home" tech test, with essentially unlimited time. The aim is to use the test to proctice OO design and TDD skills.

## Specification

### Requirements

* You should be able to interact with your code via a REPL like IRB or the JavaScript console.  (You don't need to implement a command line interface that takes input from STDIN.)
* Deposits, withdrawal.
* Account statement (date, amount, balance) printing.
* Data can be kept in memory (it doesn't need to be stored to a database or anything).

### Acceptance criteria

**Given** a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2012  
**And** a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2012  
**And** a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2012  
**When** she prints her bank statement  
**Then** she would see

```
date || credit || debit || balance
14/01/2012 || || 500.00 || 2500.00
13/01/2012 || 2000.00 || || 3000.00
10/01/2012 || 1000.00 || || 1000.00
```

## User Stories

From the specification, I have generated the following user stories. 

```
As a bank customer
So that I can securely store my money
I want to be able to *deposit* my money into a *bank account*
```
```
As a bank customer
So that I can spend my money
I want to be able to *withdraw* my money from my *bank account*
```
```
As a bank customer
So that I can see what I have spent on my account
I want to be able to *view* an *account statement*
```
```
As a bank customer
So that I can see my most recent purchases first
I want to be able to see my *transactions* in *reverse chronological* order
```
```
As a bank manager
So that my customers cannot withdraw more money than agreed
I want to be able to *reject* transactions that breach the *minimum limit*
```

## Design Approach

The program is split into 4 classes described below, each indedendently unit tested.

**BankAccount:** This manages user transactions  
**transaction:** This stores information pertaining to the transaction: Date / Credit or Debit / balance after transaction  
**transaction_history:** This stores all previous transactions  
**print_statement:** This formats the transactions for printing to stdout

The code is constructed so that transaction interactions are handled by the bank account class, this class delegates responsibility for storing transaction information, storing transactions and formatting transaction data for printing the summary to ```transaction```, ```transaction_history``` and ```print_statement``` classes respectively. In this way each class can have a single responsibility. A ```transaction``` object is created and stored by the ```transaction_log``` class which is initialised by calling a ```deposit``` or ```withdraw``` method from the ```bank_account class```. The ```statement``` method creates an object of the ```print_statement``` class, which takes all exising transactions and formats them for printing to stdout.

## Domain Model

Instance variables and methods attributed to each class

| **BANK_ACCOUNT**     | **TRANSACTION**      | **TRANSACTION_HISTORY** | **PRINT_STATEMENT**
| ---------------      | -------------------  | ---------------         | ---------------

### Example Usage 

```
require program:
  2.6.3 :001 > require './lib/bank_account.rb'
  => true 

create account:
  2.6.3 :002 > account = BankAccount.new
  => #<BankAccount:0x00007fb554090360 @balance=0, @transactions=#<TransactionHistory:0x00007fb554090338 @transactions=[]>> 

make deposits:
  2.6.3 :003 > account.deposit(1000)
  => "Deposit successful" 
  2.6.3 :004 > account.deposit(2000)
  => "Deposit successful" 

make a withdrawal:
  2.6.3 :005 > account.withdraw(500)
  => "Â£500.00 withdrawn successfully" 

print statement:
  2.6.3 :006 > account.statement
  date || credit || debit || balance
  28/01/2020 ||  || 500.00 || 2500.00
  28/01/2020 || 2000.00 ||  || 3000.00
  28/01/2020 || 1000.00 ||  || 1000.00
```
