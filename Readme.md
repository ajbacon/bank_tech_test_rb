# Bank tech test

Makers week 10 practice tech test. This is a mock "Take Home" tech test, with essentially unlimited time. The aim is to use the test to OO design and TDD skills.

## Specification

### Requirements

* You should be able to interact with your code via a REPL like IRB or the JavaScript console.  (You don't need to implement a command line interface that takes input from STDIN.)
* Deposits, withdrawal.
* Account statement (date, amount, balance) printing.
* Data can be kept in memory (it doesn't need to be stored to a database or anything).

### Acceptance criteria

**Given** a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2012  
**And** a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2012  
**And** a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2012  
**When** she prints her bank statement  
**Then** she would see

```
date || credit || debit || balance
14/01/2012 || || 500.00 || 2500.00
13/01/2012 || 2000.00 || || 3000.00
10/01/2012 || 1000.00 || || 1000.00
```

## User Stories

From the specification, I have generated the following user stories. 

```
As a bank customer
So that I can securely store my money
I want to be able to deposit my money into a bank account
```
```
As a bank customer
So that I can spend my money
I want to be able to withdraw my money from my bank account
```
```
As a bank customer
So that I can see what I have spent on my account
I want to be able to view an account statement
```
```
As a bank customer
So that I can see my most recent purchases first
I want to be able to see my transactions in reverse chronological order
```

## Desing Approach

The program is split into 4 classes described below, each indedendently unit tested.

## Original Specification

Today, you'll practice doing a tech test.

For most tech tests, you'll essentially have unlimited time.  This practice session is about producing the best code you can when there is a minimal time pressure.

You'll get to practice your OO design and TDD skills.

You'll work alone, and you'll also review your own code so you can practice reflecting on and improving your own work.
